# Additional Information

## Simulation Logic Flow

The typical flow for running a simulation:

1. Create a `Mine` record with basic parameters
2. Add `MachineryInstance` records for the mine's equipment
3. Define sustainability parameters for the mine/equipment
4. Create a `SimulationRun` record
5. For each simulation iteration:
   - Determine which events occur (based on probability functions)
   - Create `SimulationEvent` records
   - Calculate impacts on sustainability parameters
   - Generate daily machinery operation data
   - Calculate sustainability metrics
   - Store results in `SimulationResult` and `MachinerySimulationResult`

## Monte Carlo Simulation Parameters

Key parameters that affect simulation outcomes:

- **Random Seed**: Controls reproducibility of simulations
- **Number of Simulations**: More simulations provide better statistical confidence
- **Time Horizon**: Typically covers the full mine lifecycle (20-50 years)
- **Event Probabilities**: Defined by functions that consider mine age, year, etc.
- **Impact Distributions**: Statistical distributions for parameter impacts

## Sustainability Score Calculation

The overall sustainability score is typically calculated as a weighted average of category scores:

```
Overall Score = (Biodiversity Score Ã 0.25) + 
                (Carbon Score Ã 0.25) + 
                (Water Score Ã 0.2) + 
                (Waste Score Ã 0.15) + 
                (Community Score Ã 0.15)
```

Each category score is calculated from its parameters, with some parameters having more weight than others.

## Event Impact Mechanics

Three types of impacts with different behaviors:

1. **Immediate**: Full impact applied at the start of the event
2. **Gradual**: Impact increases linearly over the event duration
3. **Delayed**: Impact applied at the end of the event

Recovery from negative impacts follows an exponential curve with a rate parameter.

## Machinery Simulation Considerations

- **Operational Hours**: Typically follow daily/weekly patterns with maintenance downtime
- **Efficiency Degradation**: Equipment efficiency decreases with age/usage
- **Maintenance Effects**: Maintenance improves efficiency but causes downtime
- **Emissions Calculation**: Based on fuel consumption and emissions factors

## Scenario vs. Simulation

Important distinction:

- **Scenarios**: Predefined sets of events with specific timing and parameters (deterministic)
- **Simulations**: Monte Carlo runs with probabilistic event occurrence (stochastic)
